# graphs
In this repository I am  going to solve all my graphs questions
1) Adjacency List: You will be given a edge vector you just need to take a adjacency list and take as input
2) bfs
3) dfs
4) detect cycle in undirected graph
5) detect cycle in directed graph
6) 
6)topological  sort
7) topological sort using bfs(kahn algorithm)
8)  check cycle in directed graph using bfs
9) Number of provinces(using dfs)
10) no of provinces (using bfs)
11) course schedule using topo
12)  course schedule using dfs
13)   course schedule 2using topo
14)    course schedule 2using dfs
15) bipartite graph using dfs
16) disjoint union set
17) dsu with pathcompression and union find
18)  satsifiability of the equations (using dsu)
19)  connecting the graph(using dsu)
