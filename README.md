# graphs
In this repository I am  going to solve all my graphs questions
1) Adjacency List: You will be given a edge vector you just need to take a adjacency list and take as input
2) bfs
3) dfs
4) detect cycle in undirected graph
5) detect cycle in directed graph
6)topological  sort
7) topological sort using bfs
8)  check cycle in directed graph using bfs
9) Number of provinces(using dfs)
10) no of provinces (using bfs)
